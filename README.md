## How to Run

### Environment Setup

This project uses Poetry for dependency management. To set up the virtual environment and install the required packages, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

To activate the virtual environment, run:

```bash
poetry shell
```

### Analysis & Plots

To run the main analysis and generate all plots, execute the following command from the root directory:

```bash
python src/generate_plots.py
```

### Compile the Report

To compile the LaTeX report (`report.tex`) into a PDF, you will need a LaTeX distribution (like MiKTeX, TeX Live, or MacTeX). Run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
pdflatex -output-directory=docs docs/report.tex
```

You may need to run the command twice to ensure all cross-references are correctly updated. This will place the generated `report.pdf` and all auxiliary files inside the `docs/` directory.
